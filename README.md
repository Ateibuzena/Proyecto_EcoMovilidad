# EcoMovilidad: Making Your Journey Easier

Welcome to EcoMovilidad! ðŸŒ±ðŸš—âœ¨

This website is a data science project focused on the fuel and electricity consumption of vehicles, whether electric, hybrid, or combustion. Our goal is to provide users with an easy-to-use and accurate tool to compare different types of vehicles based on their main features and estimate the costs associated with their consumption per journey, thereby enabling informed decisions about which vehicle best suits their needs.

## About EcoMovilidad

Over the past decade, we have witnessed a steady increase in CO2 emissions, driven by economic growth and our reliance on fossil fuels. Despite advancements in clean technologies, the challenge of climate change remains urgent and requires immediate action.

Thatâ€™s why we offer a detailed analysis of different vehicles so you can understand which ones are more "eco-friendly" and make decisions that contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable future.

## Main Features

- **EcoJourney**: Explore different electric, hybrid, or combustion vehicles to make comparisons and plan your trips.
- **EcoStudy**: Perform a comprehensive analysis of categories, energy ratings, range, battery capacity, consumption, emissions, and engine types of the vehicles.
- **EcoSurvey**: Test your environmental awareness with our survey.
- **EcoHistory**: Observe the evolution of fuel prices over time and predict their prices in the coming weeks.
- **EcoTeam**: Meet the team behind EcoJourney and discover their professional profiles.
- **EcoFAQs**: Find answers to frequently asked questions about our website.
